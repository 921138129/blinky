# Blinky

<img src="readme-img/blinky-rocket.png" align="right" width="220px"/>

Proof of concept to __put peripheral vision into games__ (without VR goggles).
Explore this interesting space by playing the _Quake demo_ with fisheyes,
panoramas, and cartographic projections.

__Why?__ The standard projection used in all games was never intended for
wide-angle views, whereas the [Panini] projection was invented to be the best
representation of your natural ~170ยบ wide vision.

__How?__ To use non-standard projections like Panini, Blinky first snaps
multiple pictures around you to form a _Globe_ of pixels.  Then it projects
all those pixels to the screen using a _Lens_.  You can enable a _Rubix_
grid if you wish to visualize the mapping.  ([Quincuncial] projection shown below)

__Try it:__ Blinky has shortcut keys for quickly trying several Globes and
Lenses.  If you want more control, use the [console
commands](#console-commands) or even [edit/create](#lua-scripts) your own
globes and lenses with Lua scripts.

__360ยบ vision:__ Blinky has many fisheye and panoramic lenses from photography,
but it also has many map projections from cartography that will give you a full
360ยบ view.

__Performance vs Quality:__ Blinky has to render 6 views per frame when using a
_Cube_ globe.  So we provide lower poly globes as a way to balance quality and
performance.  Fewer renders means each view has to cover more area with less
resolution.

## Technical Details

Blinky is a modification of the famous [Fisheye Quake].

- adds a Lua scripting environment for defining:
  - _Globes_ (for capturing the environment)
  - _Lenses_ (for projecting a wide-angle image)
- uses the cross-platform [TyrQuake] engine for Windows, Mac, and Linux

### Building from source

After some [manual setup](BUILDING.md) for your OS, you can build/play with:

```
$ ./build.sh
$ ./play.sh
```

### Console Commands

Press `~` to access the command console.  Use the `Tab` key for help completing
a partial command.

```sh
fisheye <0|1>     # enable/disable fisheye mode
f_help            # show quick start options
f_globe <name>    # choose a globe (affects picture quality and render speed)
f_lens <name>     # choose a lens (affects the shape of your view)

f_fov <degrees>   # zoom to a horizontal FOV
f_vfov <degrees>  # zoom to a vertical FOV
f_cover           # zoom in until screen is covered (some parts may be hidden)
f_contain         # zoom out until screen contains the entire image (if possible)

f_rubix           # display colored grid for each rendered view in the globe
f_saveglobe       # take screenshots of each globe face (environment map)
```

### Lua Scripts

To create/edit globes and lenses, check out the following guides:

- [Create a Globe](game/lua-scripts/globes)
- [Create a Lens](game/lua-scripts/lenses)

### Engine Code

- [engine/NQ/fisheye.c](engine/NQ/fisheye.c) - new engine code
- [engine patch](engine/fisheye.patch) - engine modifications

## Future

I hope to apply this to modern graphics using frame buffers for
environment-capturing and pixel shaders for projection.  It would be
interesting to see its impact on performance.

If this modern method is performant enough, I think Panini/Stereographic could
easily become a standard for gamers demanding wide-angle video.  But if it is
not performant enough for live applications, I think it could still prove
useful in post-processed videos using something like [WolfCam].  For example,
spectators could benefit from wide-angle viewings of previously recorded
competitive matches or even [artistic montages].
